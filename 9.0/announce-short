Version 9.0.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded
the J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at
https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:
- Improved support for curved geometries
- Support for particle-in-cell methods
- Dedicated support for automatic differentiation
- Interfaces to more external libraries and programs: Assimp,  Gmsh,
  nanoflann, ROL, ScaLAPACK and Sundials.
- C++11 is now both required and used
- Support for GPU computations via CUDA
- Support for face integrals and significant improvements of the
  matrix-free framework

The main features of deal.II are:
- Extensive documentation and 57 working example programs
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Locally refined adaptive meshes and multigrid support
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
  scaling from laptops to clusters with 100,000+ of processor cores
- Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
